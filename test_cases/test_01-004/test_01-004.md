3. `repair_shop[2] { ... }` — *PartUsage* with multiplicity, with body, and
not explicitely typed
4. `test_vehicle:Vehicle;` — *PartUsage* without multiplicity, without body,
and typed explicitly
5. `vehicle:Vehicle { ... }` — *PartUsage* without multiplicity, with body,
and typed explicitly
6. `a:WheelAxle[2];` — *PartUsage* with multiplicity, without body, and typed
