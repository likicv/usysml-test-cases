# Test Case 01-003: *PartUsage* element


## Description

Explores characterists of *PartUsage* element.


## Scope

The scope of this Test Case is uSysML v0.01, and the applicable
keywords are: `package`, `part def`, and `part`.


## SysML v2 textual notation

```sysml
{% include "test_01-003.sysml" %}
```


## uSysML output

```
{% include "test_01-003.output" %}
```


## Discussion

The keyword `part` declares a part usage element. A part usage element
is called *PartUsage* in the Sysml v2 abstract syntax diagrams, and is
denoted as '[PartUsage]' in the uSysML output.

The base Element for *PartUsage* is `Parts::parts` from the Systems
Library. *PartUsage* is always typed by *PartDefinition*, either
explicitly or implicitly. If *PartUsage* is not typed explicitly
its type is determined by its base element. The base element for
*PartUsage* is `Parts::parts` from the Systems Library, which itself
is typed by `Parts::Part` (the base definition for *PartDefinition*).

In this test case example, the following holds:
* `vehicle` is *PartUsage* element that is typed explicitly by *PartDefinition*
`Vehicle`
* `w` is *PartUsage* element that is typed explicitly by *PartDefinition*
`Wheel`
* `q` is *PartUsage* not typed explicitly (and thus it is implicitly typed
with `Parts::parts`)


## Notes

**Note 1**. There are other possible base types for *PartUsage*:
* `RequirementCheck::stakeholders` from the Requirements library model
* `RequirementCheck::actors` from the Requirements library model
* `Case::actors` from the Cases library model
* `Item::subparts` from the Items library model

Note that for each of the above the base Element is typed by *PartDefinition*,
and therefore *PartUsage* is always typed by *PartDefinition*.

These base types are outside of the scope of uSysML v0.01 and hence not
discussed as a part of this Test Case.
