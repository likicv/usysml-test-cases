# Test Case 01-005: Namespace search rules


## Description

Illustrates namespace search rules.


## Scope

The scope of this Test Case is uSysML v0.01, the applicable keywords
are: `package`, `part def`, and `part`.


## SysML v2 textual notation

```sysml
{% include "test_01-005.sysml" %}
```


## uSysML output

```
{% include "test_01-005.output" %}
```


## Discussion

The namespace search starts from its own namespace, then proceeds into
the parent namespaces in the order, until the Root namespace is reached.
A name may defined in the Root namespace outside of any package.

In package `PackageVehicles2`, *PartDefintion* `Wheel` exists both within
the package `PackageVehicles2` and *PartUsage* `vehicle` namespaces (and
furthermore, *PartUsage* `vehicle` namespace is nested within the package
`PackageVehicles2` namespace). In this case, *PartUsage* `w` is typed by
*PartDefinition* `Wheel` that is within the *PartUsage* `vehicle` namespace.

Using FQENs, the following statements are true:

* `Root.PackageVehicles1.vehicle.w` is *PartUsage* typed by *PartDefintion*
`Root.PackageVehicles1.Wheel`
* `Root.PackageVehicles2.vehicle.w` is *PartUsage* typed by *PartDefintion*
`Root.PackageVehicles2.vehicle.Wheel`
* `PackageVehicles2.Wheel` is *PartDefintion* that isn't used
* `Root.PackageVehicles2.vehicle.w.lb` is *PartUsage* that is typed by
`Root.Lugbolt`
