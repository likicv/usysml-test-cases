# Test Case 01-001: Fully qualified element name (FQEN)


## Description

Parsing a `*.sysml` file will generate a fully qualified element name
(FQEN) for each element, starting with `Root`.


## Scope

The scope of this Test Case is uSysML v0.01, and the applicable
keywords are: `package`, `part def`, and `part`.


## SysML v2 textual notation

```sysml
{% include "test_01-001.sysml" %}
```


## uSysML output

```
{% include "test_01-001.output" %}
```


## Discussion

Within a sysml file all fully qualified element names (FQENs) must be
uniqe. The following example should generate an error, because both
`part def Wheel` and `part Wheel` have the same FQEN
`PackageVehicles.Wheel`:


```sysml
{% include "test_01-001.error.sysml" %}
```


A potential issue arises when multiple `*.sysml` files are processed.
Let’s assume two files, `Vehicles1.sysml` and `Vehicles2.sysml` with
the following content:


*--file Vehicles1.sysml--*
```
part def Vehicle;
part def Wheel;
```

*--file Vehicles1.sysml--*
```
part def Vehicle;
```


Let’s assume a SysMLv2 processor `sysmlv2` which can take one or more
`*.sysml` files on the input. Then processing the first file will
result in:


```
$ sysmlv2 Vehicles1.sysml
Root.Vehicle [PartDef]
Root.Wheel [PartDef]
```


And processing the second file will result in:


```
$ sysmlv2 Vehicles2.sysml
Root.Vehicle [PartDef]
```


When the two files are processed together:


```
$ sysmlv2 Vehicles1.sysml Vehicles2.sysml
```


the FQENs for the element `Root.Vehicle` will create a name clash.


## Notes


**NOTE 1**: This test case assumes that each `*.sysml` file defines the
namespace for the elements it contains. The top level namespace bounded
by the file is assigned to the element `Root`.

**NOTE 2**: The Pilot implementation pocesses the example:

```sysml
{% include "test_01-001.error.sysml" %}
```

with no errors, but issues the following warnings:


```sysml
WARNING:Duplicate owned member name (1.sysml line : 4 column : 14)
WARNING:Duplicate owned member name (1.sysml line : 5 column : 10)
```
