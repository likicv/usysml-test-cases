# Test Case 02-001: A single line note ("//"-type comment)


## Description

Shows the use of //-type comment.


## Scope

The scope of this Test Case is uSysML v0.02, the applicable keywords
are: `package`, `part def`, and `part`.


## SysML v2 textual notation

```sysml
{% include "test_02-001.sysml" %}
```


## uSysML output

```
{% include "test_02-001.output" %}
```


## Discussion

A comment embedded within the SysML v2 textual notation is used to
annotate the textual notation. There are multiple types of comments
in SysML v2 (see KerML 7.1.2.3), and specifically KerML distingushes
*notes* and *comments*, where

* *notes* are used to annotate the SysML textual notation and are
discarded during parsing
* *comments* are parsed and into to Comment elements and are stored
as part of the model

This test case addresses only *note*, and furthermore of the two
kind of notes (*singe line note* and *multiline note*) addressed
only a single-line note.


## Notes

**Note 1**. As per KerML 7.1.2.3:

>"A single-line note includes all the text from the initial
>characters '//' up to the next line terminator or the end
>of the input text (whichever comes first)."
